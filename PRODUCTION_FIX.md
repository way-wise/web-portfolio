# Production 500 Error Fix Guide

## Issues Identified

The 500 errors in production are likely caused by:

1. **Environment Variables**: MongoDB connection string is hardcoded
2. **Connection Configuration**: Missing proper MongoDB connection options for production
3. **Error Handling**: Insufficient error logging for debugging
4. **Network Restrictions**: Production environment might have different network access

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated MongoDB Connection (`lib/mongodb.ts`)
- ✅ Added environment variable support
- ✅ Improved connection options for production
- ✅ Better error handling and logging
- ✅ Added connection pooling and timeout configurations

### 2. Enhanced API Error Handling
- ✅ Added detailed logging in login route (`app/api/auth/login/route.ts`)
- ✅ Added detailed logging in seed route (`app/api/seed/route.ts`)
- ✅ Better error responses with development details
- ✅ Comprehensive error tracking

## Steps to Fix Production Issues

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Production

You need to set the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable in your production environment:

**For Vercel:**
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your project settings
3. Go to "Environment Variables"
4. Add: `MONGODB_URI` = `mongodb+srv://tech:ow7rzHZysF8wcVkW@cluster0.szywy2o.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`

**For Netlify:**
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Navigate to Site settings > Environment variables
3. Add the same variable

**For other platforms:**
Set the environment variable according to your hosting platform's documentation.

### Step 2: Verify MongoDB Network Access

Ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster allows connections from your production server's IP address:

1. Go to MongoDB Atlas dashboard
2. Navigate to Network Access
3. Add your production server's IP or use `0.0.0.0/0` for all IPs (less secure but easier)

### Step 3: Test the Connection

After deploying the updated code and setting environment variables:

1. Try the seed endpoint: `POST /api/seed`
2. Check the logs in your hosting platform's dashboard
3. Try the login endpoint: `POST /api/auth/login`

### Step 4: Monitor Logs

The updated code now provides detailed logging. Check your hosting platform's logs to see:
- Database connection status
- API request processing steps
- Detailed error information

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Security Improvements
- Consider using a more secure MongoDB connection string
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Add request validation middleware

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- The connection pooling is now configured for better performance
- Consider adding caching for frequently accessed data

### 3. Monitoring
- Set up error monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
- Monitor database connection health
- Track API response times

## Testing Locally

To test the changes locally:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://tech:ow7rzHZysF8wcVkW@cluster0.szywy2o.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
NODE_ENV=development
```

2. Restart your development server
3. Test the API endpoints

## Expected Results

After implementing these fixes:
- ✅ 500 errors should be resolved
- ✅ Better error messages for debugging
- ✅ Improved connection stability
- ✅ Detailed logging for troubleshooting

If issues persist, check the logs for specific error messages and ensure all environment variables are properly set in production.
